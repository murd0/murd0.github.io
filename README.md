# Murdo Moyse

* I'm on a data science grad scheme at [NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk), where I'm working in the Innovative Uses of Data team to generate new insights from health
data.
* I did an MChem at Durham before deciding to learn more about machine learning.
* Projects worked on include developing an internally used python package [codon](https://github.com/codonlibrary/codonPython), developing CI/CD pipelines for data science projects, and modelling on large datasets.
